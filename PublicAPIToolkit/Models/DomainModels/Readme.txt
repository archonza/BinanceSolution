The domain model describes the data you work with in the middle tier of the application. The domain model is expected to provide a faithful representation of the entities that populate the business domain. These entities are typically persisted by the data-access layer and consumed by services that implement business processes. The domain model is also often referred to as the entity model or simply as the data model. The domain model pushes a vision of data that is, in general, distinct from the vision of data you find in the presentation layer. (Note that the domain model “may” be the same model you work with in the presentation layer, but this should be taken as the exception rather than the rule.)
